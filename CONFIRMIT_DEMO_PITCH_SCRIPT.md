## 🎯 Opening Hook (30 seconds)

"Hey everyone, I'm Rasheed Yekini, and I need to tell you about something that keeps me up at night.

Last month, my friend Victor wanted to buy a new macbook, he sent ₦2.5M to what looked like a legitimate business vendor on Jiji. Beautiful website,amazing product, professional receipts, glowing reviews. But the moment Victor sent the money they said they didn't receive payment (an obvious lie). In no time, the Account closed and Victor was blocked from calling their number. Business vanished. ₦2.5M - just... gone.

Here's the crazy part - this isn't something rare. In Nigeria alone, **₦5 billion** is lost to fraud like this every single year. That's not a typo. Five. Billion. Naira.

So we built ConfirmIT. And today, I'm going to show you how we're using Hedera blockchain to make this type of fraud basically impossible."

## 🔍 Problem Deep Dive (45 seconds)

Conversely, Vendors often get scammed by customers too via fake receipt.

[**Screen share: Open a fake receipt in Photoshop**]
Let me show you how easy it is to get scammed right now.

See this Opay receipt? Looks legit, right? I edited a ₦1500 real receipt to ₦1.5M just with my windows laptop AI photo editorin about 8 minutes. Nobody can tell it's fake just by looking at it.



[** Summary **]

3603101649, Renmoney this is the account detail that scammed Victor, Traditional systems can't tell you anything about it safety.

And businesses? They can fake CAC certificates, buy fake reviews, disappear after scamming hundreds of people, then re-register under a new name next month. The cycle never ends.

That's the problem we're solving."

## 💡 Solution Demo - Part 1: QuickScan (90 seconds)

"Okay, so here's ConfirmIT. Let me show you how it works.

[**Navigate to QuickScan page**]

This is QuickScan - our AI-powered receipt verification. Watch this.

[**Upload a legitimate receipt**]

I'm gonna be uploading the original Opay receipt I edited and the fake one to our platform right now. Our AI is now doing something really interesting - it's running forensic analysis on this image. 

[**Point to real-time progress indicators**]

See this? It's checking:
- OCR extraction - reading every character on the receipt
- Metadata forensics - examining the image properties  
- Manipulation detection - looking for signs of edits
- Merchant verification - cross-referencing against our database of verified businesses

And... there we go.

[**Results appear: Trust Score 92/100, Verdict: Authentic**]

Trust Score: 92 out of 100. Verdict: Authentic. The merchant is verified on our platform.

But here's where Hedera comes in - and this is crucial.

[**Click 'Anchor to Hedera Blockchain'**]

By clicking this button, we're creating a permanent, tamper-proof record of this verification on the Hedera blockchain.

[**Show Hedera transaction appearing**]

See this transaction ID? This receipt verification is now permanently recorded on Hedera's distributed ledger. Nobody can change it. Not me, not ConfirmIT, not even the Opay themselves.

[**Click 'View on Hedera Explorer'**]

This opens HashScan - Hedera's public blockchain explorer. Anyone in the world can verify this receipt was authenticated at this exact timestamp. It's court-admissible evidence now.

Why does this matter? If I'd mess around and go and used my fake receipt with a business that uses confirmit and I get got, I can never claim that 'I never issued that receipt' even six months from now, The mechant now have cryptographic proof that says otherwise. That's the power of blockchain."

## 💡 Solution Demo - Part 2: AccountCheck (60 seconds)

Now let's see how confirmit would be a game changer for Victor moving forward.

"let's check that scammer account that scammed him.

[**Navigate to AccountCheck**]

[**Enter account: 3603101649, select 'Other' bank, manually type 'Renmoney'**]

See this? We've added support for even unlisted banks because scammers love using obscure financial institutions.

[**Click Check Account**]

And... wow. Look at this.

[**HIGH RISK result appears with fraud reports**]

Trust Score: 15/100. High Risk. Three fraud reports filed against this account in the last 30 days. Total amount lost: ₦247,000.

[**Click 'View Fraud Reports'**]

Here are the actual reports from victims. Dates, descriptions, amounts. This account is flagged in our system.

Now imagine if Victor had checked this account before sending that ₦2.5M. He would've seen these warnings.

So, the logic behind what you've just seen is our community-driven report system. Think of Truecaller ID but for account verification instead of true call.

Now let's check a verified business.






## 🎖️ Solution Demo - Part 3: Trust ID NFT (60 seconds)

[**VERIFIED BUSINESS result with NFT card**]

As a business owner that wants customer to even close their eyes and send money to your account without any worries of being scammed, that want investor to invest in your business without doubting if you're legit ror not, how do you acheive this level of credibility? Just register your business at Confirmit, 

When a business gets verified on ConfirmIT - we don't just give them a badge and call it a day. We mint them a Trust ID NFT on Hedera.

[**HashScan page opens showing the NFT**]

This NFT is like a permanent, unforgeable digital certificate. It contains:
- Business verification date
- Trust score at time of verification
- Verification tier
- Business identity that can never be changed

Here's why this is revolutionary:

**One** - It's immutable. Once minted, this NFT cannot be deleted or edited. Not by the business, not by ConfirmIT admins, not by anyone.

**Two** - It's public. Anyone can verify this business's legitimacy by checking this NFT on HashScan. Banks, investors, customers, regulators - total transparency.

**Three** - It prevents identity switching. Traditional systems? A business scams people, closes down, reopens under a new name next month. With our NFT system? That business identity is permanently linked to their Hedera NFT. They can't escape their history.

**Four** - It's traceable. If this business's trust score drops from 85 to 20 after fraud reports, we can prove they *were* verified and trustworthy at this exact date. Courts can use this as evidence. Insurance companies can verify claims. It's forensic-grade trust infrastructure.

This is what Web3 was meant to do - create permanent, trustless verification that protects real people from real fraud."

## 🌍 Impact & Vision (30 seconds)

"So let's talk impact.

**₦5 billion** lost annually to fraud in Nigeria alone. ConfirmIT can reduce that by 80% through:
- AI-powered receipt forensics that catches fake documents
- Account verification that flags scammers before they strike  
- Blockchain-anchored trust records that businesses can't manipulate

We're not just building an app. We're building the **trust infrastructure for African commerce**.


Remember my friend Victor? If ConfirmIT had existed three months ago, he'd still have that ₦2.5M with him or at least his Macbook. That's why we're building this.

Thank you."
